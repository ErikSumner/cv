        <p>I love God and seek ways to express his beauty and power in the world.  These ways include serving others (by giving them what they value, as evidenced by what they will pay money for), exploring the wonder of God's creation both physically and in the imagination, and communing with my fellow humans via entertainment, conversation, cooperation and competition.  To be more specific, I write, arrange, record, and perform my own music and others', I use the spoken word in order to convey all kinds of information, and I create digital media (on websites) in order to share the joy of living with other humans, through teaching what I know about various subjects, including music, philosophy, political and economic theory, and morality.</p></td>
